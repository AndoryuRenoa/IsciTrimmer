Notes:

MS Outlook's copy/paste of email files is currently blocked by this app. In src/.../Trimmer.java there are notes that could fix this by including a string length limit prior to altering string.

Occassionally fails to manipulate clipboard, notes in src/.../Trimmer.java regarding solution. Currently solvable by switching off and on again.
